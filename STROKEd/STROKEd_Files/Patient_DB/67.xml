Glucose comes from the foods you eat. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. With type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, the more common type, your body does not make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, the glucose stays in your blood.####1#2012-08-28 17:29:14.0#Diabetes##100#Non Diabetic/Diabetic/#[Non Diabetic, Diabetic]#9#Non Diabetic##null@1#2012-08-28 17:29:14.0#Hypertension is the term used to describe high blood pressure.

Such narrowing stems from focal, progressive atherosclerosis of the affected vessel.

This is called coronary artery disease and happens slowly over time. It's the major reason people have heart attacks.

Other kinds of heart problems may happen to the valves in the heart, or the heart may not pump well and cause heart failure. Some people are born with heart disease.
